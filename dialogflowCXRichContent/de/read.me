Here is the **final system flow** you can copy and reuse:

### ‚úÖ Final System Flow

1. **User submits an idea** via **Jad Lite**, embedded in the **Gall Canvas App**.
2. **Jad Lite conversational agent** queries **Vertex AI Search** to check for **semantic similarity** with existing ideas.
3. * If **similarity is high**, the idea is **rejected**, and the user is notified.
   * If **similarity is low/medium**, the idea is **sent to a Google Cloud Function**.
4. The **Cloud Function writes the idea into Microsoft Dataverse**.
5. A **Dataverse Change Stream** triggers another **Google Cloud Function**.
6. This second Cloud Function **writes the idea to Cloud Storage**.
7. **Cloud Storage** is indexed by **Vertex AI Search** to update its semantic idea base.
8. **Jad Lite** continues serving future user queries by checking against the **updated Vertex AI Search index**.

üß© Components for Diagram
I‚Äôll now generate a clean, visual architecture diagram with these components and logos:

Microsoft Dataverse (idea submission form)

Power Automate or webhook (event trigger)

Google Cloud Function (stream listener)

Cloud Storage (JSON idea store)

Vertex AI Search (semantic index)

Jad Lite (Google Conversational Agent)

Users (idea submitter interacting with agent)

Sure! Here's a **professional architectural introduction** and **flow explanation** for your system, which you can include in documentation, presentations, or proposals:

## üß† Architecture Overview: Jad Lite AI Idea Similarity Agent

**Jad Lite** is a Google Conversational Agent embedded within a Power Platform **Canvas App** called **Gall**. It is designed to analyze newly submitted AI ideas against a knowledge base of existing ideas using semantic similarity. This solution leverages **Microsoft Dataverse** for structured storage, **Google Cloud Functions** for event-driven orchestration, **Cloud Storage** as an intermediary store, and **Vertex AI Search** for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-style similarity checks.

The core objective is to **automatically detect duplicate or overlapping AI ideas** at the time of submission and promote innovation by avoiding redundant efforts across business units.

---

## üîÅ System Flow Explanation

1. **User Interaction via Gall App**
   Users interact with **Jad Lite** through the **Gall Canvas App**, submitting new AI ideas using a chat-based conversational interface.

2. **Similarity Check by Jad Lite Agent**
   Before accepting the idea, **Jad Lite** immediately calls **Vertex AI Search** to compare the submitted idea with previously stored ideas. The similarity is ranked as **high**, **medium**, or **low** based on semantic distance.

3. **Decision Based on Similarity Match**

   * If **similarity is high**, the idea is flagged as a potential duplicate, and **rejected** with an explanation shown to the user.
   * If **similarity is low or medium**, the idea is considered **distinct** and is passed to a **Google Cloud Function** for further processing.

4. **Persisting Ideas to Dataverse**
   The Cloud Function writes the accepted idea into **Microsoft Dataverse**, enabling centralized, governed storage and access through Power Platform tools.

5. **Change Detection in Dataverse**
   A **change stream** on the Dataverse table detects the new idea entry and triggers a **second Cloud Function**.

6. **Data Pipeline to Cloud Storage**
   The second Cloud Function pulls the new idea and saves it in a structured format (e.g., JSON Lines) to **Google Cloud Storage**.

7. **Updating the Semantic Index**
   The **Cloud Storage bucket** is integrated with **Vertex AI Search**, which automatically **indexes the new idea**. This keeps the semantic knowledge base up to date for future similarity checks.

8. **Feedback to Users**
   The next time a user submits an idea via Jad Lite, the entire flow repeats‚Äînow with an updated set of existing ideas.

Absolutely! Here's the **updated architecture introduction** incorporating all key functionalities of your Jad Lite agent, written professionally and clearly:

---

## üß† Architecture Overview: Jad Lite ‚Äì AI Idea Analysis & GenAI Guidance Agent

**Jad Lite** is a Google Conversational Agent embedded within the **Gall Canvas App** (built using Microsoft Power Platform). It is designed as an intelligent assistant to **streamline AI idea management, enhance understanding of Generative AI processes, and guide users on agent-based architectures and implementation patterns**.

The system leverages cross-platform integration‚Äîcombining **Microsoft Dataverse**, **Google Cloud Functions**, **Vertex AI Search**, and **Cloud Storage**‚Äîto deliver smart automation, semantic reasoning, and user-friendly interaction.

---

### üéØ Core Functionalities of Jad Lite

1. üîç **AI Idea Similarity Analysis & Submission**
   When a user submits a new AI idea, Jad Lite automatically checks for **semantic similarity** with existing ideas using **Vertex AI Search**. If the idea is sufficiently distinct, it is stored in **Dataverse**; otherwise, it is flagged as a duplicate and rejected with reasoning.

2. üìö **Explaining Generative AI Concepts**
   Jad Lite educates users on the key building blocks of **Generative AI**, such as prompt design, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), vector embeddings, model selection, and evaluation strategies‚Äîoffering tailored, contextual guidance within the chat interface.

3. üß© **Guidance on Agent Spaces & AI Architecture Patterns**
   The assistant also acts as a **learning companion** to help users understand and apply **agentic design principles**‚Äîcovering tools like Google Agent Builder, Dialogflow CX, Playbooks, and integration patterns between data sources, APIs, and search layers.
