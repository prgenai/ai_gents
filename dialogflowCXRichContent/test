- 4. Ask the user: "What would you like to do next?"
- 5. Present the following options clearly:
    - 1. Submit another idea
    - 2. Return to the main menu
- 6. Routing Logic:
    - IF user selects "1" (or expresses intent to "submit another idea"): Route to: `${PLAYBOOK:intake_submit}`
    - IF user selects "2" (or expresses intent to "return to the main menu"): Route to: `${PLAYBOOK:Default Generative Playbook}`

==========
Goal: To collect and confirm a new GenAI idea from the user.
Instructions:
- 1. Ask the user: "Great! Let's submit your new GenAI idea. Please describe your idea in detail. What problem does it solve, and how would GenAI be used?"
- 2. Receive the user's detailed idea description. Call a designated TOOL to process and save the idea. For example: `${TOOL:submit_genai_idea(idea_description=${user_input})}`. (Note: Replace 'submit_genai_idea' with your actual tool name and 'user_input' with the variable for the user's idea, as per your tool definition.)
- 3. Provide confirmation message to the user: "Thank you! Your GenAI idea has been successfully submitted." (Optional: "Your submission ID is [ID_FROM_TOOL_OUTPUT]. You can use this to check its status later.")
- 4. End the Playbook.
