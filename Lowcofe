🧱 Definitions in Agentic Platforms

Term	Description	Typical User	Examples in Agentic Platform
No-Code	Build agents using drag-and-drop interfaces or natural language instructions. No coding required.	Business users, analysts	- Agent Designer UI in Agentspace- Playbooks with natural-language steps
Low-Code	Mostly visual with occasional scripting or configuration; some logic can be added.	Power users, solution engineers	- Adding tool calls or custom API connectors- Using parameters in Playbooks
Pro-Code	Full programmatic control using SDKs and APIs. Allows advanced logic, tools, and integration.	Developers, ML engineers	- Building agents using Vertex AI ADK- Custom toolchains with Python or LangChain

🔍 Detailed View

✅ No-Code
	•	Tools: Agentspace UI, Playbook Designer
	•	Key Features:
	•	Define goals and steps using plain English
	•	Add examples for few-shot prompting
	•	Use pre-built tools like search or form fill
	•	Use Case: A marketing user builds an agent to fetch campaign stats from SharePoint

🔧 Low-Code
	•	Tools: Tool configuration, JSON parameter binding, simple API calls
	•	Key Features:
	•	Custom data connections
	•	Tool output formatting
	•	Dynamic response shaping
	•	Use Case: An analyst configures a REST API tool that fetches product data based on user selection

💻 Pro-Code
	•	Tools: Vertex AI ADK, Python SDK, Agent Engine deployment
	•	Key Features:
	•	Define agent memory, tools, behaviors in code
	•	Compose multiple agents (multi-agent orchestration)
	•	Full CI/CD integration, observability, debugging
	•	Use Case: A developer builds a Gemini-powered financial advisor agent that invokes ML models and APIs

🧩 Why This Layering Matters

Agentic platforms allow hybrid teams (business + tech) to collaborate:
	•	Business users build with no-code tools
	•	Engineers extend them with pro-code integrations
	•	All users operate within a unified platform like Vertex AI or Agentspace

✅ Summary

Level	Control	Complexity	Use Cases
No-Code	🟢 Basic	🟢 Easy	Info lookup, FAQs, simple workflows
Low-Code	🟡 Medium	🟡 Moderate	Tool calls, parameter logic
Pro-Code	🔴 Full	🔴 Complex	Custom AI copilots, agent orchestration
