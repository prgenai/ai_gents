# User Query Types for AI Idea Evaluation Agent

As an AI architect, here are the primary types of questions and requests users would likely ask your AI Idea Evaluation Agent, organized by functional categories:

## Idea Submission & Initial Evaluation

5. "Does my idea overlap with existing initiatives?"

## Similarity Analysis

6. "Show me ideas similar to mine about [brief description]"
7. "Find the top 3 ideas most similar to ID-123"
8. "What's the similarity score between my idea and [specific existing idea]?"
9. "How does my recommendation engine idea compare to existing recommendation systems?"
10. "Are there any ideas in the knowledge base that address [specific business problem]?"

## Pattern Classification

11. "What type of AI pattern is my idea classified as?"
12. "Is this considered an agentic AI or generative AI solution?"
13. "How many predictive analytics ideas do we have in the knowledge base?"
14. "Show me all hybrid AI ideas that combine generative and analytical capabilities"
15. "What's the distribution of AI patterns across our idea database?"

## Refinement & Differentiation

16. "How could I modify my idea to make it more unique?"
17. "What aspects of my idea are novel compared to similar ones?"
18. "What additional features would differentiate my idea from ID-456?"
19. "Which parts of my proposal overlap with existing solutions?"
20. "How can I combine elements from existing ideas to create something new?"

## Knowledge Base Exploration

21. "What are the most recent AI ideas submitted in [department/area]?"
22. "Show me all ideas related to customer service automation"
23. "Which ideas use large language models for [specific application]?"
24. "Are there any AI solutions proposed for [specific business challenge]?"
25. "What's the most common type of AI idea in our knowledge base?"

## Trend Analysis

26. "What AI patterns are trending in our idea submissions this quarter?"
27. "Is my idea following current innovation trends or breaking new ground?"
28. "Which business areas have the most AI idea submissions?"
29. "Are there any underexplored applications for AI in our organization?"
30. "How has the focus of AI ideas evolved over the past year?"

## Implementation Guidance

31. "What information should I add to strengthen my idea submission?"
32. "Based on similar ideas, what challenges might I face implementing this?"
33. "Are there existing projects I should connect with based on my idea?"
34. "What additional context would help evaluate my idea more accurately?"
35. "How might I expand on the most unique aspects of my proposal?"

By supporting these query types, your idea evaluation agent will deliver comprehensive value to users throughout the innovation lifecycleâ€”from initial concept validation through refinement and potential implementation planning.

# Questions a Human Idea Reviewer Would Ask the AI Evaluation Agent

As an AI architect, here are the types of questions a human idea reviewer (someone who evaluates or manages the innovation process) would likely ask your AI Idea Evaluation Agent:

## Assessment Validation Questions

1. "Why did you classify idea #123 as a duplicate of #456? Their implementations seem different."
2. "What specific features made you determine this idea is unique despite similar concepts?"
3. "Can you explain the similarity score calculation between these two ideas?"
4. "What were the key semantic elements that triggered this high similarity score?"
5. "How confident are you in this uniqueness assessment given the limited description?"

## Process Efficiency Questions

6. "Summarize the top 5 duplicate patterns you've identified across our idea submissions."
7. "Which departments are submitting the most redundant ideas?"
8. "What percentage of our idea submissions are truly unique versus variations of existing concepts?"
9. "How has the uniqueness ratio changed over the past quarter?"
10. "Which idea categories have the highest duplication rates?"

## Decision Support Questions

11. "Should we approve this idea for further development despite its similarity to existing concepts?"
12. "Between these similar ideas (#234 and #567), which one has more innovative potential?"
13. "What modifications would make this borderline idea worth pursuing?"
14. "Does this idea justify creating a new project or should it be merged with an existing initiative?"
15. "How would you prioritize these three similar ideas based on their unique aspects?"

## Pattern Recognition Questions

16. "What emerging AI patterns are we not yet exploring in our innovation pipeline?"
17. "Are there any idea clusters forming that we should consolidate into formal programs?"
18. "Which AI pattern has shown the most evolution in our recent submissions?"
19. "Can you identify any blind spots in our current innovation portfolio?"
20. "Are our employees focusing too narrowly on certain AI applications?"

## Collaboration Facilitation Questions

21. "Which teams should collaborate based on their complementary idea submissions?"
22. "Who else in the organization is working on similar concepts to this new submission?"
23. "Can you identify potential mentors for this idea based on similar past submissions?"
24. "Which existing projects could benefit from incorporating elements of this new idea?"
25. "What cross-departmental opportunities exist based on our idea submission patterns?"

## System Performance Questions

26. "How accurate have your similarity assessments been based on subsequent human review?"
27. "What types of ideas are most challenging for you to classify correctly?"
28. "What additional data would improve your evaluation accuracy?"
29. "How has your pattern recognition improved as the knowledge base has grown?"
30. "Where are the false positives most commonly occurring in your similarity detection?"

## Strategic Insight Questions

31. "Based on our idea submissions, which AI capabilities should we prioritize developing?"
32. "What untapped AI opportunities exist based on gaps in our current idea portfolio?"
33. "How aligned are our employee-submitted ideas with our strategic AI priorities?"
34. "Which business areas have the most innovative AI ideas relative to submission volume?"
35. "What AI trends in our idea database differ from broader industry trends?"

These questions reflect the needs of human reviewers who are using the AI agent as a tool to make better decisions, identify patterns, foster collaboration, and derive strategic insights from the organization's collective innovation efforts.
