Domain-Based Distinction Rule
🔹 If two ideas use similar techniques (e.g., summarization), but target different domains or business use cases, treat them as distinct ideas.

Examples:

✅ "Call Center Summarization" vs. "KYC Document Summarization" → Distinct

❌ "Customer Chatbot for Travel Insurance" vs. "Customer Chatbot for Health Insurance" → Potentially Similar, check intent

You must always consider domain, data source, and business intent when determining similarity
